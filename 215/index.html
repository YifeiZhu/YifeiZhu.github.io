<p>Office Hours: Thursdays 10:20 am–12:20 pm</p>

<p>Grader: <a href="mailto:12231283@mail.sustech.edu.cn">曲庆睿 QU Qingrui</a></p>

  
<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>This is a half of the graduate compulsory courses in Geometry and Topology, the other half being MAT8024 Differentiable Manifolds.  
  The main topics are homology and cohomology.</p>

<p>For undergraduate students, this is a sequel to MA323 Topology, developing 
  further algebraic (and computable) machinery beyond the fundamental group and covering maps 
  to analyze spaces qualitatively.</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Topology (MA323) or consent of the department.</p>


<h3>Textbooks</h3>

<p>The main references will be Hatcher's <i>Algebraic Topology</i> 
(online version available <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html" target="_blank">here</a> 
along with additional exercises and content items) and 
姜伯驹<a href="https://sustc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=86SUSTC_ALMA_CN2133849450004181&context=L&vid=86SUSTC&lang=en_US&search_scope=default_scope&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,%E5%90%8C%E8%B0%83%E8%AE%BA" 
      target="_blank">《同调论》</a>.</p>

<p>This semester we will cover homology and cohomology roughly corresponding to Chapters 2 and 3 of Hatcher, 
along with supplementary materials such as fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and spectral sequences.  
Jiang's Chinese text is also quite handy and helpful at times.</p>


<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>There will be one final exam worth 50% of your final grade.</p>


<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>The assigned problems for each week are due each Tuesday in-class at 2 pm, listed on this page. 
Homework is worth 50% of your final grade. 
Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time.</p>

<p>We encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, 
including strategies for solving different kinds of problems. 
However, when you actually write up your solutions, you must do this on your own.</p>
