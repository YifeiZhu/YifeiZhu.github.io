<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>This course introduces the basic concepts in probability theory which form the basis for all applications of probability and statistics, and for 
   further probability and statistical theory including, in particular, stochastic processes.  It also introduces the basic probability methods and 
   techniques with a strong emphasis on applying these standard methods and techniques appropriately and with clear interpretation.</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Mathematical Analysis II (MA102a&#47;MA122) or Calculus II (MA127).</p>


<h3>Textbooks</h3>

<p>We will be working from the first 6 chapters of John A. Rice's 
   <a href="https://sustc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com.cn/permalink/86SUSTC_INST/tcg6ar/alma991000401229704181" target="_blank"><i>Mathematical statistics and 
   data analysis</i>, third edition</a>.  There is a 
   <a href="https://sustc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com.cn/permalink/86SUSTC_INST/tcg6ar/alma991000578829704181" target="_blank">Chinese translation</a> of the 
   book.</p>

<p>Useful references include Douglas G. Kelly's <i>Introduction to probability</i> and Sheldon Ross's 
   <a href="https://sustc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com.cn/permalink/86SUSTC_INST/tcg6ar/alma991000396759704181" target="_blank"><i>A first course in 
   probability</i></a>.</p>


<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>There will be one in-class midterm exam, on April 11, and one final exam.  Each of these exams is worth 30% of your final grade.</p>


<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>The assigned problems for each week are due each Tuesday in-class at 8 am, listed on this page.  Homework is worth 40% of your final grade.  Students 
   must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time.</p>

<p>We encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, including strategies for solving different kinds of problems.  However, when you 
   actually write up your solutions, you must do this on your own.</p>
