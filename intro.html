<h2>Intro</h2> 

  <p>
    Hi everyone,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First I want to thank the organizers for bringing us together.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My name is Yifei Zhu.  I'm a grad student at the University of Minnesota 
    entering my 5th year.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For what I've been doing about algebraic topology, I've been studying power 
    operations in elliptic cohomology.  These can be viewed as higher analogs of 
    the Steenrod operations in ordinary cohomology and the Adams operations in 
    K-theory.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'll try to avoid further technicalities and just say something about 
    motivations.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Last week there was a doodle on the Google homepage celebrating 
    the French mathematician Fermat's 410<sup>th</sup> birthday.  When I 
    first saw it in the morning when I opened my computer, I felt something really refreshing 
    and exciting.  There was 
    the <q>Google</q> logo on a blackboard, not 
    quite completely erased, covered by the 
    inequality $X^n + Y^n \neq Z^n, [n>2]$, 
    together with a mouse-over comment which was nothing but Fermat's tantalizing remark making an excuse of not 
    writing down his <q>truly marvelous</q> proof.  
  </p>
  
  <p>    
    OK, I'm not claiming my research has anything to do with 
    Fermat's last theorem, with all the deep theories underlying its 
    actual proof which is truly <q>truly marvelous</q>.  But the math involved, especially the world of elliptic curves, 
    is something I've been gradually appreciating more and more.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I remember reading an article on the Notices of the AMS by its editor Andy 
    Magid reflecting on his forty years since receiving his PhD degree.  He 
    mentioned that a former colleague of his had an interesting 
    image for learning and working in math: he liked to 
    quip that his professional goal was to slow the increase 
    in the distance between the math he did and the math 
    he appreciated.  His point, that as one continues working and 
    learning, areas one thought would always be too difficult 
    to understand can become accessible, if still too hard 
    to be part of one's research agenda.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That said, a good thing of studying operations in the so-called 
    <q>elliptic</q> cohomology theories is that one can translate algebraic topology to quite explicit calculations 
    with elliptic curves.  There is a larger framework behind this, called 
    chromatic theory, where algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and number theory interact.  In order to 
    understand this, I've also been spending time learning algebraic geometry, 
    which is quite a tough thing for me.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Lastly, as instructed by the organizer I should talk about something I'd genuinely 
    like to know about other participants: besides math, I LOVE classical music, 
    my favorite composers being Bach and Mozart.  Over the years I've 
    almost given up trying to find someone talking about classical music, so never 
    mind.  Thank you!
  </p>
