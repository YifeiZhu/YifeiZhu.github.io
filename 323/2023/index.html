<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Abstract Algebra (MA214/219) or consent of the Department.</p>


<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>This course introduces basic notions and examples in general topology and algebraic topology, with a view towards more advanced analysis, (algebraic and differential) geometry, and topology studies, as well as applications.</p>

<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>There will be one in-class midterm exam, on November 17, and one final exam.  
  Each of these exams is worth 30% of your final grade. </p>


<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>The assigned problems for each week are due each Friday in-class at 2 pm, listed on this page. 
Homework is worth 40% of your final grade. 
Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time.</p>

<p>We encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, 
including strategies for solving different kinds of problems. 
However, when you actually write up your solutions, you must do this on your own.</p>
