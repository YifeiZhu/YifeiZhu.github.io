<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Abstract Algebra (MA214/219) or consent of the department.</p>


<h3>Textbooks</h3>

<p>We will be working from James R. Munkres's <i>Topology</i>, Second Edition.</p>

<p>Useful references include《基础拓扑学讲义》尤承业编著 and《点集拓扑与代数拓扑引论》包志强编著 as well as M.A. Armstrong's <i>Basic Topology</i>.</p>
  
<p>The textbook and the references are available at <a href="https://lib.sustech.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Lynn Library</a>.</p>
  

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>This course introduces basic notions and examples in general topology and algebraic topology, 
  with a view towards more advanced analysis, (algebraic and differential) geometry, and topology courses.
  We will cover most of Chapters 1-4, 7, 9, and 11-13 in the Munkres text.</p>


<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>There will be one in-class midterm exam, on November 3, and one final exam.  
  Each of these exams is worth 30% of your final grade. </p>


<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>The assigned problems for each week are due each Tuesday in-class at 2 pm, listed on this page. 
Homework is worth 40% of your final grade. 
Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time.</p>

<p>We encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, 
including strategies for solving different kinds of problems. 
However, when you actually write up your solutions, you must do this on your own.</p>
