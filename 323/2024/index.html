<p>Office hours: Thursdays 10:20 am–12:10 pm</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
  Abstract Algebra (MA214/219) or consent of the Department.  
  Although strictly (and traditionally) speaking notions such as groups and group homomorphisms will not be used until the 
  latter half (or even later) of this course on the fundamental group(oid) of a topological space and its computation, 
  familiarity with basic abstract algebra is necessary for acquiring a sophistication with writing proofs and 
  for supplying examples, intuitions, and analogies.
</p>


<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>
  This course introduces basic notions, examples, and applications of topology, 
  a subject aimed to classify "spaces" according to those of their properties that are invariant under continous deformations (in contrast to those sensative to metrics).  
  With the classification theorem for closed surfaces as a main goal, 
  we will cover point-set topology systematically 
  together with elements of geometric and algebraic topology, 
  incorporating standard Chinese textbooks such as 尤承业's 基础拓扑学讲义 (Chapters 1–4) as well as 
  Munkres's {\em Topology} and 
  Bradley, Bryson, Terilla's {\em Topology – A categorical approach} (2020).  
  This includes categories, functors and their adjunction, universal properties, and examples; 
  compactification; 
  topological manifolds, partition of unity, and embeddings of manifolds into Euclidean spaces; 
  simplicial complexes, Euler characteristic, and orientation; 
  function spaces, the compact–open topology, homotopy, and basic ideas of higher categories; 
  projective spaces, lens spaces, Dehn surgery, and knots; 
  glimpses of topological classifications of physical systems and of topology-enhanced machine learning.
</p>

<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>There will be one in-class midterm exam, on April 19, and one final exam.  Each of these exams is worth 30% of your final grade.</p>


<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>
  The assigned problems for each week are due each Tuesday in-class at 2 pm, listed on this page.  
  Homework is worth 40% of your final grade.  
  Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time.  
  You may send an electronic version of your homework (TeX'd up or scanned properly, in PDF format) to the grader at the mouse-over email address from above.
</p>

<p>We encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, including strategies for solving different kinds of problems.  However, when you actually write up your solutions, you must do this on your own.</p>
